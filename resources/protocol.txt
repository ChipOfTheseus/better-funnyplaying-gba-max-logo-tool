1. Send 4 bytes
[0]: 0xAA
[1]: 0x51 + logo slot index
[2-3]: uint16, total send buffer size

2. Wait for 0x55 response byte

3. Fill send buffer - 12 bytes of 4 palette colors (BGR), followed by RLE image data

4. Send 128 bytes from the send buffer

5. Wait for 128 * 0x55 response bytes

6. If there are still blocks in the send buffer, go back to step 4

7. Send remainder (N < 128) bytes from the send buffer

8. Wait for N * 0x55 response bytes

total 16 bytes of header data
max 4070 bytes of RLE image data

RLE:

every byte is: 2 upper bits - palette color index, 6 lower bits - number of pixels with that color (0-63)
